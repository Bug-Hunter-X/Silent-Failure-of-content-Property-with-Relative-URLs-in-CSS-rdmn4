The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if you use `content` with a value that contains a relative URL (like `url(../images/icon.png)`) that's not accessible via the CSS file's path, you'll get a visually empty result, with no error messages in the browser console. This can be difficult to debug because there's no clear indication of what's wrong.
